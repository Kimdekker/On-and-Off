# On-and-Off
To turn the light on and off in the browser

I used HTML and CSS only to build a switch to turn the light on and off. Or you could say go from lightmode to darkmode and back. 
Therefore I used a checkbox inputfield and in css custom properties + :has to make it work + some "smart" CSS selectors to make the cute little animation work with the :has selector :) enjoy and feel free to check out the code.
